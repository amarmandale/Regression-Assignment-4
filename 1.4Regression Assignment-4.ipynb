    "### Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and How Does It Differ from Other Regression Techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Regression** (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a type of linear regression that incorporates L1 regularization. The regularization term added is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Function = Loss Function + λ 1∑p |b_j|\n",
    "\n",
    "where λ is the regularization parameter, and (b_j) are the coefficients of the predictors. Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques like \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** or **Ridge Regression** by its ability to drive some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. This contrasts with OLS, which does not include regularization, and Ridge Regression, which uses L2 regularization to shrink coefficients but does not set them to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is the Main Advantage of Using Lasso Regression in Feature Selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to perform\n",
    "\n",
    "**automatic feature selection**. By applying L1 regularization, Lasso can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, thereby excluding those features from the model. This is particularly useful when dealing with datasets with many predictors, as it helps to identify and retain only the most relevant features, simplifying the model and improving interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How Do You Interpret the Coefficients of a Lasso Regression Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, the coefficients represent the relationship between each predictor and the response variable, but with a crucial difference: some coefficients may be zero due to the L1 regularization. Non-zero coefficients indicate the predictors that are retained in the model and are considered important, while zero coefficients indicate predictors that have been excluded. Thus, the magnitude of non-zero coefficients reflects their relative importance, but the presence of zero coefficients also helps in understanding which features are deemed irrelevant by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What Are the Tuning Parameters That Can Be Adjusted in Lasso Regression, and How Do They Affect the Model's Performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is **λ** (the regularization parameter):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **λ**: Controls the strength of the regularization. A higher λ increases the penalty on the size of coefficients, leading to more coefficients being shrunk to zero. Conversely, a lower λ reduces the penalty, resulting in coefficients closer to those found by OLS. Choosing an appropriate λ is crucial for balancing model fit and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Can Lasso Regression Be Used for Non-Linear Regression Problems? If Yes, How?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression is inherently a linear regression technique. However, it can be adapted for non-linear problems by transforming the input features into a higher-dimensional space where the relationship with the response variable may be linear. This is done using methods such as polynomial features or kernel functions. After transformation, Lasso can be applied in this new feature space, effectively handling non-linear relationships by leveraging linear modeling in a transformed space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. What is the Difference Between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ridge Regression** uses L2 regularization, which adds a penalty proportional to the square of the coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Function = Loss Function + λ 1∑p b_j^2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Regression** uses L1 regularization, adding a penalty proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Function = Loss Function + λ 1∑p |b_j|\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences**:\n",
    "- **Ridge**: Shrinks coefficients but does not set any to zero, which helps with multicollinearity but does not perform feature selection.\n",
    "- **Lasso**: Can shrink some coefficients to zero, performing feature selection by excluding less relevant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Can Lasso Regression Handle Multicollinearity in the Input Features? If Yes, How?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity. By applying L1 regularization, Lasso encourages sparsity in the model, which can reduce the impact of multicollinear features by shrinking some coefficients to zero. This helps in stabilizing the estimates of the remaining features and improving model performance when predictors are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. How Do You Choose the Optimal Value of the Regularization Parameter (λ) in Lasso Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose the optimal value of λ:\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model performance across different values of λ and select the value that minimizes the validation error.\n",
    "2. **Grid Search**: Perform a grid search over a specified range of λ values and choose the one with the best performance based on a selected criterion.\n",
    "3. **Regularization Path Algorithms**: Use algorithms such as LARS (Least Angle Regression) to efficiently compute the solution path as λ varies, facilitating the selection of the optimal value.\n"
